# [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) -  `Medium`

## Problem

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

### Example Input

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

root = `[1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]`

### Example Output

Level order traversal as:
```
[
    [1],
    [3,2,4],
    [5,6]
]
```
## Solution
```java
```
### Complexity

#### Time

#### Space

### Data Structures/Patterns

### Pros

### Cons
